<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Jea Lorie A. Lor, and I live in the Philippines. Ever since elementary school, math has been my favorite subject. <br /> 
  I’m not the best at it, but I enjoy solving problems and challenging myself. <br />
  I also love eating—whether it's savory dishes or sweet treats, food always brings me joy.<br /> 
  During my free time, I like playing games because they help me relax and have fun.


<p>I’m usually quiet, but when I’m with people I’m comfortable with, I can be loud and playful. <br>
   I value sincerity and kindness, and I try to be someone others can trust. <br> 
   I know I still have a lot to learn, especially when it comes to English and writing, but I enjoy the process of improving. <br>
   I like discovering new things and pushing myself to become better.</p>

<p>One of my biggest goals is to master web development.<br /> 
  I find it interesting how websites are made and how code can create something useful.<br /> 
  I may not be perfect, but I believe in growing slowly and steadily.<br />
  I do my best every day, and I believe that effort, honesty, and a kind heart will take me far.</p>
